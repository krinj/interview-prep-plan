# Krin's Interview Prep Plan 2019

This document contains the plan I followed to prepare for technical interviews at major tech companies (Google, Amazon, Facebook, etc). It will list in detail the resources and strategy that I used.

## Plan

Month 1 & 2

* Read **Cracking the Coding Interview**. Do all the exercises (and write tests for your solutions if you can). This book was an excellent starting point. It covers everything, and should get you most of the way there. 

Month 3

* **Daily (1 hour):  Hand written algorithms**. Print out this sheet and time yourself writing each algorithm by hand. Pick a different one each time. Once you have written it, transfer it into code and test it. Once the tests pass, stop the timer and record your performance. If the test doesn't pass, then make a note of what you did wrong, and correct it.
* **Daily (2 hours):  Solve coding problems.** You need to learn to deal with problems you've never seen. So go to *LeetCode* (or any other sites that offer this service) and work on the puzzles. Time yourself as well, to simulate the pressure.
* **Weekly: Watch interview videos.** Watching someone else go through the interview process is highly valuable. If you can, then pause the video and try to solve the problems yourself before resuming it and watching how the candidate performs.

Month 4

* **Weekly**: Mock interviews. Schedule some mock interview sessions with friends or colleagues who would be willing to help you. Also sometimes it's useful to be the one conducting the interview as well, just to experience it from the other side.
* **Weekly**: Watch some resources about system design. Study an example of a large scale system design.
* **Weekly**: Spend some time to read up and understand more advanced algorithms. This is not essential knowledge, but could help you land a higher offer.
* **Daily (1.5 hours)**: Continue to solve new problems or hand write algorithms to keep your skills fresh.
* **Daily (0.5 hours)**: Write and refine behavioural examples.
